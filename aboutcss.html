    <p>
      CSS is the magic behind beautiful websites. It controls how things look — colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and animations.
    </p>

    <p>
      With CSS, you can transform plain HTML into eye-catching, responsive designs. Whether you're styling buttons or building complex grid layouts, CSS gives you full control.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>🌈 Customize the look of any element</li>
      <li>📱 Make sites responsive with media queries</li>
      <li>💫 Add smooth transitions and animations</li>
      <li>🧠 Master Flexbox & Grid for powerful layouts</li>
    </ul>
