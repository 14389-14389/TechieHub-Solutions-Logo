    <h1>☕ Java</h1>

    <p>
      Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language known for its <strong>portability</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and <strong>performance</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s widely used in:
      <ul>
        <li>📱 Android app development</li>
        <li>🏢 Enterprise-level backend systems</li>
        <li>🌐 Web servers and cloud-based applications</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Java runs on the <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong>, meaning you can write code once and run it anywhere!
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Java isn't just a language — it's a career path. Master it, and you're ready for real-world software development!"
